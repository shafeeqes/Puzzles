Using only a four-minute hourglass and a seven-minute hourglass, what time can be measured with the process not taking longer than the time we are trying to measure.

 NOTE: This is a multiple choice question. Check all the times which are measurable.
 
 
 
 
 For 8 mins, use the 4 min hourglass twice. For 11 mins, use 4 min hourglass followed by 7 min hourglass.
For 9 mins, start both hourglasses at 0 minutes. Flip over the four-minute glass when it runs out (at 4:00);
ditto for the seven-minute glass (at 7:00). When the four-minute glass runs out the second time (at 8:00), 
the seven-minute glass will then have one minute of sand in its lower bulb. 
Flip the seven-minute glass over again and let the minute of sand run back. When the last grain falls, that will be nine minutes.
